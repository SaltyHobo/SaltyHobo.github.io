Folder for FCC Front End Libraries challenges.
<div>
<p>The content and styling are very simple. The purpose of these projects is to utilize front-end libraries.</p>
<p>(note 1: While I normally prefer to maintain styling and scripts in separate files, for these projects I included everything in the HTML file for the sake of keeping everything in one place.)</p>
<p>(note 2: On my machine these files are working just fine, but you are having trouble loading the scripts, please try opening them on CodePen and choose Babel preprocessor.)</p>
